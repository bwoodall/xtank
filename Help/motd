The latest Xtank beta release is available via anonymous FTP on the
host ftp.pix.net, in the directory /pub/xtank.

Be sure to read the builtin Release Notes.  Also, you should
probably check out the FAQ answers that have been included.

Please *NOTE* -- this is an beta quality release.  As such, there
are known bugs, feature problems and so forth, but the general
feeling is that it is important to get this code out the door so
that people can play with it.
