              Release Notes for the Xtank 1.6.0 Release

New features:

 * Rewritten Makefile/GNUmakefiles for building on various systems.
   So, no more imake, and Imakefiles.
   Tested on: FreeBSD/Linux/Mac OS X

 * Threading now defaults to THREAD_SWAPCONTEXT.  This is the
   only threading support that has been tested for this release.

 * Relicensed code under BSD 2-clause license for core of the
   game.  Two files (sload.l, sound.c) are Public Domain.  It is
   possible to compile the game without these two files.

 * ANSI C style function prototypes everywhere.

Removal of old code, where the authors could not be located
or failed to respond to attempts to contact them.  It would be
really nice if any of the authors of the code that was removed
would consider relicensing their code.
